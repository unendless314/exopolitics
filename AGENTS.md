# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a phased, modular UAP/UFO aggregation system plan. Top-level contracts live in `docs/`; implementation work belongs in `modules/<module>/` with `docs/`, `config/`, `src/`, and `tests/`.

Planned module sequence:
`ingest -> classify -> curate -> edit (when needed) -> translate -> publish -> site` (with `analysis` operating as a read-only sidecar observer)

The active module workspace has been reset. Archived pre-reset module trees live under `modules_archive/`; new implementation work should restart under `modules/` and preserve future module boundaries.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no repo-wide build or CI pipeline yet. Use lightweight local commands while working:

- `rg --files` to quickly inspect repository contents
- `sed -n '1,200p' docs/README.md` to review the active top-level documentation set before edits
- `git diff -- docs/ modules/ modules_archive/` to verify changes across planning, active module, and archived module paths when structural moves are involved

When executable code is added, prefer module-local commands from `modules/<module>/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use Markdown for planning docs and YAML for configuration. Keep prose direct and use fenced code blocks for commands or layouts.

Naming patterns:

- Canonical specs: uppercase snake case (example: `ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md`)
- Config files: lowercase with underscores (example: `new_rss_sources.yaml`)

Keep config ownership inside each module (`modules/<module>/config/`). Add a root `config/` only when multiple modules stably share one contract.

## Architecture & Ownership Rules
Respect module boundaries from `docs/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md`:

- `ingest`: source ingestion and source health
- `classify`: LLM classification contracts
- `curate`: editorial curation, triage, formatting, and routing decisions
- `edit`: edit-draft provenance and responsibility metadata
- `translate`: multilingual translations and display title refinement
- `publish`: export and disclosure emission
- `site`: render published outputs only; no canonical DB writes
- `analysis`: read-only diagnostics, operational reporting, and metric aggregation
- `dashboard`: read-only rendering of `analysis` JSON reports; no DB access, no metric recomputation

## Testing Guidelines
No automated test suite is committed yet. For new executable code:

- place tests under `modules/<module>/tests/`
- mirror source layout where possible
- use `test_<unit>.py` naming for Python tests

Before opening a PR, validate changed YAML with the intended parser and verify references such as `category_id`, `fetch_group`, and `schedule_class`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing commit style: short, imperative subjects (example: `Refine architecture planning docs`). Keep subject lines specific and do not end with punctuation.

PRs should include a concise summary, affected paths, rationale for structural moves, and linked docs/issues. Include screenshots only for visual output changes and list deferred decisions.

## Agent Notes
Do not invent undocumented runtime behavior. Keep top-level docs focused on active cross-module contracts, and put implementation details in module docs. Historical planning belongs in `docs_archive/` and historical module snapshots belong in `modules_archive/`; neither should be treated as current source of truth. Any new scaffold, schema, or state transition must update `modules/<module>/docs/` in the same change.
